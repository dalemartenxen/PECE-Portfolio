                Our professional electronics engineering consultancy services are founded on the mandate of <span className="text-primary font-semibold">Republic Act No. 9292, otherwise known as the Electronics Engineering Law of 2004</span>. Under <span className="text-primary font-semibold">Section 5 of the Act</span>, the scope and practice of Electronics Engineers cover the application of engineering sciences and principles in the design, planning, construction, installation, operation, testing, maintenance, and management of electronic systems and networks across various fields such as ICT, telecommunications, broadcasting, industrial and consumer electronics, avionics, aerospace, medical electronics, robotics, biometrics, and convergent technologies.

                What sets the <span className="text-primary font-semibold">Professional Electronics Engineer (PECE)</span> apart is the <span className="text-primary font-semibold">exclusive authority</span> granted under RA 9292, Section 5(b) â€” the sole authority to provide consulting services and to sign and seal electronics engineering plans, designs, specifications, reports, permit applications, and other technical documents prepared by themselves or under their direct supervision. This ensures not only technical soundness but also legal validity and regulatory compliance for projects requiring electronics engineering expertise.
